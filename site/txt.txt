As a precaution, we've been called by the zoo."The zoo – which is home to about 900 <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/animals" title="More from guardian.co.uk on Animals">animals</a> and is spread across 32 hectares (80 acres) – responded by closing until the errant apes had been rounded up."Twycross zoo can confirm that one of their group of chimpanzees found their way into a secure service area within their enclosure," said a statement on its website. "This required closure of the zoo whilst keepers encouraged the chimps back into their normal living areas with ice-cream and fizzy drinks."The statement said the incident had posed no risk to the public, adding that no chimps or humans were harmed.The zoo reopened at 11.30. It has promised an internal investigation into the episode.The chimps were said to be fine – "if not a little excited about having ice-cream for breakfast".The statement made no mention of the chimps' teatime plans.
