<p><em><strong>Walking Dress.</strong></em> - A cambric muslin round dress; the bottom of the skirt is trimmed with a flounce of scolloped work, disposed in deep plaits at some distance from each other, and the spaces between left plain; in the middle of each space is a muslin tab; this trimming is surmounted by another composed of full puffings of muslin, with lozenges between, and a rouleau of muslin at the top. High body, tight to the shape, profusely ornamented with work, and trimmed at the wrists and round the throat with scolloped lace. Spencer of cerulean blue <em>soi de Londres</em>: it is tight to the shape; the waist is the usual length, and it is finished with a full bow and ends of the same material, corded with satin in the middle of the back. The bust is formed in a most becoming manner, by a fold of satin edged with a loop trimming of <em>soi de Londres</em>, which goes in a sloping direction from the shoulder to the bottom of the waist. The long sleeve is finished at the hand with satin folds and loop trimmings; the epaulette is a mixture of satin and <em>soi de Londres</em>, disposed in an extremely novel and tasteful style, falling collar, finished with bands of satin and loop trimming. Head-dress, a bonnet composed of white watered <em>gros de Naples</em>; the brim, of a moderate size, turns up a little, and is ornamented under the edge with a band of blue tufted gauze; a piece of <em>gros de Naples</em> goes round the crown, cut at bottom and top in the form of leaves, and edged with narrow straw plait. A full bunch of these leaves and a bouquet of <em>marguerites</em> are placed on one side of the crown, and a bouquet of <em>marguerites</em> only on the other. Broad white satin strings, tied in a full bow on the left hand side. Black silk shoes. Limerick gloves.</p>
