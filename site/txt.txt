It cited a lack of progress on arms control, trade, missile defence and human rights, and added: "Russia's disappointing decision to grant Edward Snowden temporary asylum was also a factor that we considered in assessing the current state of our bilateral relationship. Our cooperation on these issues remains a priority for the <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/usa" title="More from guardian.co.uk on United States">United States</a>".</p><p>A meeting between the defense secretary Chuck Hagel, the secretary of state John Kerry and their Russian counterparts will go ahead in Washington on Friday as planned.</p><p>In a separate announcement, the White House said Obama will visit Sweden instead, travelling to Stockholm the day before the St Petersburg summit.  "Sweden is a close friend and partner to the United States," it said in a statement. "[It] plays a key leadership role on the international stage including in opening new trade and investment opportunities."</p><p>Speaking on Monday night, Obama said he was disappointed that Russia had allowed Swowden to stay instead of sending the former government contractor back to the US to face espionage charges.</p><p>In his first direct comments about Snowden since Russia's decision last week, the president said the situation reflected "underlying challenges" in dealing with Moscow. "There have been times where they slip back into cold war thinking and a cold war mentality," Obama said on NBC's Tonight Show.</p><p>Snowden, an ex-NSAÂ systems analyst, is accused of leaking details about highly secretive government surveillance programs. He spent several weeks in the transit zone of a Moscow airport before being granted asylum for a year.</p><p>The White House has said Obama would attend the international summit in St Petersburg as it was important for the US to be represented at talks among global economic powers. </p><p>Obama also criticised a new Russian law cracking down on gay rights activism, saying he has "no patience for countries that try to treat gays and lesbians and transgendered persons in ways that intimidate them or are harmful to them".</p><p>Russia has said it will enforce the law when it hosts the 2014 Winter Olympics in Sochi. Asked whether the law would affect the games, Obama said he believed Putin and Russia have "a big stake in making sure the Olympics work".</p><p>"I think they understand that for most of the countries that participate in the Olympics, we wouldn't tolerate gays and lesbians being treated differently," he said. Although the White House has chosen to focus on Snowden in recent days, Moscow's decision to grant him asylum is only the latest flashpoint in an increasingly strained relationship between the two countries.</p><p>Russia's refusal to join international condemnation of Syrian president Assad has been the most serious source of tension, hinting at the danger of Cold War-style proxy conflicts between the two nations and blocking US efforts to oust the Syrian leader.</p><p>The latest White House statement also cites arms control as a growing problem too. Obama's recent calls for fresh reductions in nuclear weapons fell on stony ground when he met Putin in a memorably chilly meeting on the sidelines of the G8 conference in Northern Ireland. Moscow worries US missile defence advances threaten to reduce the effectiveness of its nuclear deterrent.</p><p>But hawks in Washington argue it is time for the White House to stop pretending it has a co-operative partner in the Kremlin and treat Russia as an adversary to be contained rather a country to be negotiated with.</p><p>"Now is the time to fundamentally rethink our relationship with Putin's Russia," said senator John McCain after Snowden was granted asylum. "We need to deal with the Russia that is, not the Russia we might wish for."</p><p>As well as completing Nato missile defence programmes regardless of concerns in Moscow, McCain is calling for an expansion of the Magnitsky Act, which applies US sanctions on Russian officials alleged to have taken part in human rights violations.</p><p>But the Magnitsky Act has also infuriated the Kremlin, which regards Washington as applying double standards on human rights, so such responses risk fuelling a spiral of tit-for-tat in retaliations likely to hurt both countries.</p><p><em>Additional reporting by the Associated Press</em></p>
