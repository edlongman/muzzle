    		<p>The Scoop is a project for YRS2013 by a team from YRS Nottingham.</p>
            <p>Say you went on holiday for a few weeks, and you were out of the news loop, and when you got back, you just wanted to know what happened without 			   having to search through sites and papers.</p>
            <p>Well, this is where The Scoop comes in, you go to our <a href="http://thescoop.io/">website</a> and select however long you were away for and 		               what category of news you want e.g(headlines).
			   And it pulls up the main headlines from the time you were away.
               It fetches a summarized paragraph and the link for the full story.</p>
            <p>That's it, very simple, very useful.</p>
